<br>  
<br>
  <li style="font-size: 30px; font-family: fantasy;" >I got my first job.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p style="font-size: larger;font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;" >
    Towards the end of the summer my friends started to get really busy with there jobs and my others friends couldn't hangout.
    So towards the end of july me and my mom started to look for a job. 
    We used a app called indeed and we found a resteraunt called Beach Haus.
    It paid 9.60 per hour + tips for a busser.
    It was located in Belmar with is about a 20 min drive from my house.
  So we got a interview and in the car ride there my mom was telling me what I should say to answer all her questions 
  Once we got there and I was waiting for the interview I was told to for the boss into a room.
  While we took that short walk into the room being nervous thinking what if I mess up she asked if I know what im signing up to do.
  I just noded.
  Then after that she just told me the main idea of what I would be doing.
  Not asking a single question after that.
  Untill she askes, "Can you start on friday?"
  I said yes then just walked back to the car confused why she didnt even ask me anything.
